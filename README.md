# Investigating Netflix Movies

Python projects on DataCamp

Apply the foundational skills in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses to manipulate and visualize movie and TV data.

In these project, I will apply the skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. Using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib, I'll try to verify that Netflix movies get shorter over time.

This project helps me gain experience in exploratory data analysis, a core data science skill that allows me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from the graphs I create from the data.
